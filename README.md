# RGB matcher in OpenRGB based on Windows Theme/Accent Colour
Python script that matches the colour of all your RGB devices visible in OpenRGB and devices addressable by VIA (e.g. QMK keyboards) with the colour of your Windows theme/accent colour. A perfect use case scenario is when using tools like Wallpaper Engine or built-in Windows theme swapping that change your accent colour of Windows whenever the wallpaper changes (to match the wallpaper). 

## Requirements
- [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/)

## Setup
1. Run OpenRGB, navigate to `Settings` and set the following options:
    - `Minimize on close` - on
    - `Start at Login` - on
    - `Start Minimized` - on
    - `Start Server` - on
    - `Set Server Host` - on, set value to `127.0.0.1`
    - `Set Server Port` - on, set value to `6742`

    Then you can close the window.

    Note: in case OpenRGB crashes at startup for any reason, you can also manually start the server by going to `SDK Server`, setting `Server Host` to `127.0.0.1`, `Server Port` to `6742` and clicking `Start Server`.

2. Install requirements:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Replace the JSON definition [file](/definition_jsons/k10_version_2_ansi_rgb.json) with the JSON file(s) obtained from the manufacturer's website for your own QMK/VIA device.

4. Create a task in Windows Task Scheduler:
    - open Task Scheduler
    - click `Create Task...`
    - in `General` tab:
        - set `Name` to `RGB_match`
    - in `Triggers` tab:
        - click `New...`
        - set `Begin the task` to `At log on`
    - in `Actions` tab:
        - click `New...`
        - set `Action` to `Start a program`
        - set `Program/script` to the absolute path to your locally installed `pythonw.exe` (`pythonw.exe` does not produce an ugly command line that would otherwise pop up when running the script with `python.exe`, this executable should be in the same folder as your normal `python.exe` on Windows)
        - set `Add arguments (optional)` to the absolute path to `RGB_match.py` file
    - in `Conditions` tab:
        - untick `Start the task only if the computer is on AC power`
    - in `Settings` tab:
        - untick `Stop the task if it runs longer than`
        - set `If the task is already running, then the following rule applies` to `Stop the existing instance`
    - click `Ok`
    - you can already start the task by selecting it and pressing `Run`, the task will always start on its own when logging onto your machine
